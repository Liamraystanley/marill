## Goal

Often times during server administration, migrations, and large server changes, things can and will go wrong. Servers are complex systems with many working parts, and with that comes a lot of breakage.

Creating an automated site testing utility, like Marill, allows:
   * Less human interaction to test sites.
   * Integration and flexibility to be built into other systems.
   * Clients to be at ease; you know they won't test all of their sites.
   * Administrators or developers to hate you less.
   * You to be witty and say "time is money!".

## Features

_Disclaimer: Marill is still in early development, and this list is subject to change drastically. (code, libraries, tools, cli-args, etc)_

   * Cross platform: Marill can compile across many platforms. linux, netbsd, openbsd, freebsd, and more. (Windows too, possibly!)
   * Configurable output. Only output what you need.
   * Many cli flags to configure input, output, what is tested, what isn't, etc.
   * Ability to test cPanel based servers, Apache, Nginx (coming soon!), and others! (any can be scanned with `--domains`)
   * Flexible testing system. You can even write your own tests! Load them from a URL in JSON format, or from a directory! (see [marill/tests](https://github.com/Liamraystanley/marill/tree/master/tests))

## How does it work?

The general idea is that you place Marill on the server you would like to test. Marill by default will then figure out the list of domains that server is hosting. Marill will then begin to act much like a browser, crawling each site (and all resources like images/css/javascript/etc if `--assets` is used). It will then pass each resource it fetches through the list of builtin, or external tests. Each domain is given a starting score of 10, and each test has a pre-defined weight. If the test matches, that score is applied to the main score. If the score falls below the minimum configured score, it is considered failed.

### Examples:

Here are a few examples of tests that are useful:

   * Visual PHP errors on the page. For example: `Warning: Invalid argument supplied for function() in /path/to/some/file.php`
   * Invalid status codes. For example, `Forbidden`, `Internal Service Error`, `Payment Required`
   * Blank pages generated by PHP (common if PHP has `display_errors` disabled)
   * MySQL or PostgreSQL related errors.
   * cPanel "Sorry!" related pages (common if the incorrect IP is configured for example).

Example running from my workstation (though, this would be best suited running from the server itself):

## Project Status:

   * [See here](https://github.com/Liamraystanley/marill/projects/1) for what is being worked on/in my todo list for the first beta release.
   * [See here](https://github.com/Liamraystanley/marill/projects/2) for what is being worked on/in my todo list for the first major release.
   * Head over to [release.liam.sh/marill](https://release.liam.sh/marill/?sort=time&order=desc) to get some testing bundled binaries, if your'e daring and willing to help test my latest pushes.
   * Head over to [Github Releases](https://github.com/Liamraystanley/marill/releases) to get more true-tested builds and versions, with change information.

## Building:
Marill supports building on 1.3+ (or even possibly older), however it is recommended to build on the latest go release. Note that you will not be able to use the Makefile to compile Marill if you are trying to build on go 1.4 or lower. You will need to manually compile it, due to limitations with ldflag support.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Liamraystanley/marill.git
$ cd marill
$ make
```

To run unit tests, then compile, simply run:

```bash
$ make test all
```

## Usage:
This is very likely to change quite a bit until we're out of beta. Please use wisely.

## Testing

So, you want to help out, test, see how things work, and find possible bugs? Follow the below steps and you will be right on your way.

### cPanel server steps:

Head to [this page](https://release.liam.sh/marill/?sort=time&order=desc) and download the top item in the list. For example, using the latest version:

```bash
$ wget -q -O- https://release.liam.sh/marill/latest.tar.gz | tar -zx -C /root/tmp/
```

You should now see a file named **marill** in `/root/tmp/`. Feel free to look over the current flags and arguments:

```bash
$ /root/tmp/marill --help
```

The main arguments that may be useful are:
   * `-a` or `--assets`: This will fetch all of the assets for the page (css/javascript/images, etc)
   * `-d` or `--debug`: This will enable debugging. It doesn't provide a whole lot more information, but can help if something isn't working.
   * `--delay`: Utilize this if the load caused by the crawling is too high. E.g. `--delay 10s`.
   * `--threads`: This is the amount of parallel scans will run at a single time. By default it will be 1/2 the amount of cores on the server.
   * `--domain-ignore` and `--domain-match`: utilize these to skip or only scan certain domains during the crawl. E.g. `--domains-ignore "*domain.com|someotherdomain.com"`

So, for example, to start off with:

```bash
$ /root/tmp/marill -a
```

### Things to note/Troubleshooting:
   * Please remove `/root/tmp/marill` once you are done. This utility is still in alpha stages, and as such, there is no update check functionality. Leaving in place may cause someone in the future to utilize an outdated version of the software.
   * If there are any problems or bugs, **PLEASE LET ME KNOW!** You can submit bugs if you have a Github account [here](https://github.com/Liamraystanley/marill/issues/new) or [here if you do not](https://gitreports.com/issue/Liamraystanley/marill)

## FAQ:
   1. **Will it cause high load?**
      * The general target at which this was written for are servers under maintenance, or being ran on a new server that is being migrated to. That being said, Marill does run scans in parallel. It will run scans in parallel in the amount of cores divided by 2. (8 core server, 4 concurrent crawls, 2 core server, 1 crawl at a time). If you see Marill still causing too much load, you can utilize `--delay` and `--threads`.

   2. **How long does Marill take to crawl sites (e.g. 1,000 sites on a server)?**
      * Given a cPanel server, is must be noted that along with the input (default http) version of a domain, the https version of the site will be scanned as well if cPanel has a certificate for it. Furthermore, it will also attempt to crawl www.domain.com, not just domain.com. As for other webservers, it all depends on the input. **Please note** that using `--assets` (`-a`), that Marill _will take longer_. This is because this fetches all resources for each site being crawled. If you would like Marill to crawl faster, don't use `-a`.
      * Generally speaking, crawling without `-a` is fairly fast.

   3. **Is it better to run Marill from inside of the server, or from a remote location?**
      * Running remotely ensures there are no ip or firewall related issues, however in the same sense if you are crawling quite a few sites, many servers may assume due to the connection count, that's your connections are malicious.
      * If ran from inside of the server, Marill can scan and determine what the server is hosting (by checking Apache, cPanel, etc).

   4. **Can I give Marill a custom IP address for which to crawl a site (before it goes live and DNS is updated)?**
      * **Yes!** For example, rather than `--domains "domain.com domain2.com"`, you can do something like:

      ```bash
      $ marill --domains "domain.com:1.2.3.4 domain2.com:2.3.4.5"
      ```

      * Also note that you can run scans on alternate ports:

      ```bash
      $ marill --domains "domain.com:1.2.3.4:8080 domain.com:9000"
      ```

   5. **Can I give Marill a custom port for which to crawl a site?**
      * **Yes!** see **FAQ #4**

   6. **Can Marill crawl sub-domains and sub-folders?**
      * **Yes!** You can pass and url into `--domains` as necessary. For example:

      ```bash
      $ marill --domains "https://domain.com/sub/folder/some-page"
      ```

      * or with a custom ip as well:

      ```bash
      $ marill --domains "https://domain.com/sub/folder/some-page:1.2.3.4"
      ```
