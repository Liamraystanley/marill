## Goal

Often times during server administration, migrations, and large server changes, things can and will go wrong. Servers are complex systems with many working parts, and with that comes a lot of breakage.

Creating an automated site testing utility, like Marill, allows:
   * Less human interaction to test sites.
   * Integration and flexibility to be built into other systems.
   * Clients to be at ease; you know they won't test all of their sites.
   * Administrators or developers to hate you less.
   * You to be whitty and say "time is money!".

## Features

_Disclaimer: Marill is still in early development, and this list is subject to change drastically. (code, libraries, tools, cli-args, etc)_

   * Cross platform: Marill can compile across many platforms. linux, netbsd, openbsd, freebsd, and more. (Windows too, possibly!)
   * Configurable output. Only output what you need.
   * Many cli flags to configure input, output, what is tested, what isn't, etc.
   * Ability to test cPanel based servers, Apache, Nginx (coming soon!), and others! (any can be scanned with `--domains`)
   * Flexible testing system. You can even write your own tests! Load them from a URL in JSON format, or from a directory! (see [marill/tests](https://github.com/Liamraystanley/marill/tree/master/tests))

## How does it work?

The general idea is that you place Marill on the server you would like to test. Marill by default will then figure out the list of domains that server is hosting. Marill will then begin to act much like a browser, crawling each site (and all resources like images/css/javascript/etc if `--resources` is used). It will then pass each resource it fetches through the list of builtin, or external tests. Each domain is given a starting score of 10, and each test has a pre-defined weight. If the test matches, that score is applied to the main score. If the score falls below the minimum configured score, it is considered failed.

Here are a few examples of tests that are useful:

   * Visual PHP errors on the page. For example: `Warning: Invalid argument supplied for function() in /path/to/some/file.php`
   * Invalid status codes. For example, `Forbidden`, `Internal Service Error`, `Payment Required`
   * Black pages generated by PHP (common if PHP has `display_errors` disabled)
   * MySQL or PostgreSQL related errors.
   * cPanel "Sorry!" related pages (common if the incorrect IP is configured for example).

## Project Status:

   * [See here](https://github.com/Liamraystanley/marill/projects/1) for what is being worked on/in my todo list for the first beta release.
   * [See here](https://github.com/Liamraystanley/marill/projects/2) for what is being worked on/in my todo list for the first major release.
   * Head over to [release.liam.sh/marill](https://release.liam.sh/marill/?sort=time&order=desc) to get some testing bundled binaries, if your'e daring and willing to help test my latest pushes.
   * Head over to [Github Releases](https://github.com/Liamraystanley/marill/releases) to get more true-tested builds and versions, with change information.

## Building:
Marill supports building on 1.3+ (or even possibly older), however it is recommended to build on the latest go release. Note that you will not be able to use the Makefile to compile Marill if you are trying to build on go 1.4 or lower. You will need to manually compile it, due to limitations with ldflag support.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Liamraystanley/marill.git
$ cd marill
$ make
```

To run unit tests, then compile, simply run:

```
$ make test all
```

## Usage:
This is very likely to change quite a bit until we're out of beta. Please use wisely.

```
