It's intended to be lightweight, flexible, and easy to use, while still being very powerful.\r\n\r\n## Table of Contents\r\n- [Goal](#goal)\r\n- [Features](#features)\r\n- [Limitations](#limitations)\r\n- [How does it work?](#how-does-it-work)\r\n  - [Examples](#examples)\r\n- [Usage](#usage)\r\n- [Getting started](#getting-started)\r\n  - [cPanel/Apache based servers](#cpanelapache-based-servers)\r\n  - [Alternatives (Nginx, Caddy, etc)](#alternatives-nginx-caddy-etc)\r\n  - [Troubleshooting](#things-to-notetroubleshooting)\r\n- [Frequently Asked Questions](#faq)\r\n  - [Will it cause high load?](#faq)\r\n  - [How long does Marill take to crawl sites (e.g. 1,000 sites on a server)?](#faq)\r\n  - [Is it better to run Marill from inside of the server, or from a remote location?](#faq)\r\n  - [Can I give Marill a custom IP address for which to crawl a site (before it goes live and DNS is updated)?](#faq)\r\n  - [Can I give Marill a custom port for which to crawl a site?](#faq)\r\n  - [Can Marill crawl sub-domains and sub-folders?](#faq)\r\n- [Building](#building)\r\n- [Project Status](#project-status)\r\n- [Contributing](#contributing)\r\n\r\n## Goal\r\n\r\nOften times during server administration, migrations, and large server changes, things can and will go wrong. Servers are complex systems with many working parts, and with that comes a lot of breakage.\r\n\r\nCreating an automated site testing utility, like Marill, allows:\r\n   * Less human interaction to test sites.\r\n   * Integration and flexibility to be built into other systems.\r\n   * Clients to be at ease; you know they won't test all of their sites.\r\n   * Administrators or developers to hate you less.\r\n   * You to be witty and say \"time is money!\".\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n_Disclaimer: Marill is still in early development, and this list is subject to change drastically. (code, libraries, tools, cli-args, etc)_\r\n\r\n   * Cross platform: Marill can compile across many platforms. linux, netbsd, openbsd, freebsd, and more. (Windows too, possibly!)\r\n   * Configurable output. Only output what you need.\r\n   * Many cli flags to configure input, output, what is tested, what isn't, etc.\r\n   * Ability to test cPanel based servers, Apache, Nginx (coming soon!), and others! (any can be scanned with `--domains`)\r\n   * Flexible testing system. You can even write your own tests! Load them from a URL in JSON format, or from a directory! (see [marill/tests](https://github.com/Liamraystanley/marill/tree/master/tests))\r\n\r\n## Limitations\r\n\r\nThere are a few limitations with Marill, due to how the utility was developed. Marill was meant to be lightweight, and portable. This means it cannot work exactly like a normal browser. Below are a few examples:\r\n\r\n   * Marill currently isn't able to take a screenshot of the site. However, there many other external resources for this. (usecase: pixel-by-pixel comparison -- easily tell if CSS is broken)\r\n   * Marill can't execute Javascript. If your site is heavy on Javascript, this tool may not be best suited. (there are some sites which rely heavily on Javascript. (however not frequently do sites Javascript break during a migration or move, unless a resource fails to load, which Marill should catch)\r\n   * Marill cannot and will not load certain resources. E.g. videos, iframes, embeds, ftp links, etc. This would make crawling the site very complex and convoluted. (however, embed plugins within things like wordpress could possibly be caught, if a test were to be written to search for bad tags)\r\n   * Marill cannot search through webserver, PHP, or other misc. logs to determine what the issue may be. This will likely never change, because adding this functionality would make the utility fragile and clunky. If there is an error, you should be able to find out what is causing it.\r\n\r\n## How does it work?\r\n\r\nThe general idea is that you place Marill on the server you would like to test. Marill by default will then figure out the list of domains that server is hosting. Marill will then begin to act much like a browser, crawling each site (and all resources like images/css/javascript/etc if `--assets` is used). It will then pass each resource it fetches through the list of builtin, or external tests. Each domain is given a starting score of 10, and each test has a pre-defined weight. If the test matches, that score is applied to the main score. If the score falls below the minimum configured score, it is considered failed.\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n\r\nHere are a few examples of tests that are useful:\r\n\r\n   * Visual PHP errors on the page. For example: `Warning: Invalid argument supplied for function() in /path/to/some/file.php`\r\n   * Invalid status codes. For example, `Forbidden`, `Internal Service Error`, `Payment Required`\r\n   * Blank pages generated by PHP (common if PHP has `display_errors` disabled)\r\n   * MySQL or PostgreSQL related errors.\r\n   * cPanel \"Sorry!\" related pages (common if the incorrect IP is configured for example).\r\n\r\nExample running from my workstation (though, this would be best suited running from the server itself):\r\n[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/bhnskk1s3vwdwgl2w52deioel.png)](https://asciinema.org/a/bhnskk1s3vwdwgl2w52deioel)\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nThis is very likely to change quite a bit until we're out of beta. Please use wisely.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ marill --help\r\nNAME:\r\n   marill - Automated website testing utility\r\n\r\nUSAGE:\r\n   marill [global options] command [command options] [arguments...]\r\n   \r\nVERSION:\r\n   git revision XXXXXX\r\n   \r\nAUTHOR(S):\r\n   Liam Stanley <user@domain.com> \r\n   \r\nCOMMANDS:\r\n     scan           [DEFAULT] Start scan for all domains on server\r\n     urls, domains  Print the list of urls as if they were going to be scanned\r\n     tests          Print the list of tests that are loaded and would be used\r\n     help, h        Shows a list of commands or help for one command\r\n\r\nGLOBAL OPTIONS:\r\n   -d, --debug              Print debugging information to stdout\r\n   -q, --quiet              Do not print regular stdout messages\r\n   --no-color               Do not print with color\r\n   --no-banner              Do not print the colorful banner\r\n   --exit-on-fail           Send exit code 1 if any domains fail tests\r\n   --log FILE               Log information to FILE\r\n   --debug-log FILE         Log debugging information to FILE\r\n   --result-file FILE       Dump result template into FILE (will overwrite!)\r\n   --no-updates             Don't check to see if there are updates\r\n   --threads n              Use n threads to fetch data (0 defaults to server cores/2) (default: 0)\r\n   --delay DURATION         Delay DURATION before each resource is crawled (e.g. 5s, 1m, 100ms) (default: 0s)\r\n   --http-timeout DURATION  DURATION before an http request is timed out (e.g. 5s, 10s, 1m) (default: 10s)\r\n   --domains DOMAIN:IP ...

Since Marill is a single binary, there are no dependencies that are needed for the utility to run.\r\n\r\nHead to [this page](https://release.liam.sh/marill/?sort=time&order=desc) and download the top item in the list. For example, using the latest version:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ wget -q -O- https://release.liam.sh/marill/latest.tar.gz | tar -zx -C /root/tmp/\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou should now see a file named **marill** in `/root/tmp/`. Feel free to look over the current flags and arguments:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ /root/tmp/marill --help\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe main arguments that may be useful are:\r\n   * `-a` or `--assets`: This will fetch all of the assets for the page (css/javascript/images, etc)\r\n   * `-d` or `--debug`: This will enable debugging. It doesn't provide a whole lot more information, but can help if something isn't working.\r\n   * `--delay`: Utilize this if the load caused by the crawling is too high. E.g. `--delay 10s`.\r\n   * `--threads`: This is the amount of parallel scans that will run at a single time. By default it will be 1/2 the amount of cores on the server.\r\n   * `--domain-ignore` and `--domain-match`: utilize these to skip or only scan certain domains during the crawl. E.g. `--domains-ignore \"*domain.com|someotherdomain.com\"`\r\n\r\nSo, for example, to start off with:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ /root/tmp/marill -a\r\n```\r\n\r\n### cPanel/Apache based servers:\r\n\r\nNote that Marill has out of the box support for cPanel and Apache servers. The way that information (like the domains that the server is hosting) is pulled from cPanel is through `/var/cpanel/` (e.g. `/var/cpanel/users/<user>` and `/var/cpanel/userdata/<domain>`), for which cPanel should keep updated.\r\n\r\nFor Apache based servers, Marill will find the current running binary, and execute `<binary> -S`, which pulls information about all loaded virtual host entries in the current running version. (see [here](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/vhosts/) for more information).\r\n\r\n### Alternatives (Nginx, Caddy, etc)\r\n\r\nIf your web server does not match the above description, you can utilize the manual domain list flag of Marill. The current syntax for this is as follows:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ marill --domains \"<items>\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nReplace **\\<items\\>** with one of the following list of inputs:\r\n   * `DOMAIN:IP:PORT`\r\n   * `DOMAIN:IP`\r\n   * `DOMAIN:PORT`\r\n   * `DOMAIN`\r\n\r\n**DOMAIN** can be any of one of the following examples:\r\n   * `domain.com`\r\n   * `www.domain.com`\r\n   * `random.subdomain.domain.com`\r\n   * `http://some-example.com/`\r\n   * `https://some-example.com/some-login.php`\r\n\r\nSo, to put it all together, you can do something like:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ marill a --domains \"somedomain.com:443 domain.com:1234 example.com:123.456.7.89:80 https://domain.com/\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Things to note/Troubleshooting\r\n   * Please remove `/root/tmp/marill` once you are done. This utility is still in alpha stages, and as such, there is no update check functionality. Leaving in place may cause someone in the future to utilize an outdated version of the software.\r\n   * If there are any problems or bugs, **PLEASE LET ME KNOW!** You can submit bugs if you have a Github account [here](https://github.com/Liamraystanley/marill/issues/new) or [here if you do not](https://gitreports.com/issue/Liamraystanley/marill)\r\n\r\n## FAQ\r\n   1. **Will it cause high load?**\r\n      * The general target at which this was written for are servers under maintenance, or being ran on a new server that is being migrated to. That being said, Marill does run scans in parallel. It will run scans in parallel in the amount of cores divided by 2. (8 core server, 4 concurrent crawls, 2 core server, 1 crawl at a time). If you see Marill still causing too much load, you can utilize `--delay` and `--threads`.\r\n\r\n   2. **How long does Marill take to crawl sites (e.g. 1,000 sites on a server)?**\r\n      * Given a cPanel server, is must be noted that along with the input (default http) version of a domain, the https version of the site will be scanned as well if cPanel has a certificate for it. Furthermore, it will also attempt to crawl www.domain.com, not just domain.com. As for other webservers, it all depends on the input. **Please note** that using `--assets` (`-a`), that Marill _will take longer_. This is because this fetches all resources for each site being crawled. If you would like Marill to crawl faster, don't use `-a`.\r\n      * Generally speaking, crawling without `-a` is fairly fast.\r\n\r\n   3. **Is it better to run Marill from inside of the server, or from a remote location?**\r\n      * Running remotely ensures there are no ip or firewall related issues, however in the same sense if you are crawling quite a few sites, many servers may assume due to the high connection count, that your connections are malicious.\r\n      * If ran from inside of the server, Marill can scan and determine what the server is hosting (by checking Apache, cPanel, etc).\r\n\r\n   4. **Can I give Marill a custom IP address for which to crawl a site (before it goes live and DNS is updated)?**\r\n      * **Yes!** For example, rather than `--domains \"domain.com domain2.com\"`, you can do something like:\r\n\r\n      ```bash\r\n      $ marill --domains \"domain.com:1.2.3.4 domain2.com:2.3.4.5\"\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n      * Also note that you can run scans on alternate ports:\r\n\r\n      ```bash\r\n      $ marill --domains \"domain.com:1.2.3.4:8080 domain.com:9000\"\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n   5. **Can I give Marill a custom port for which to crawl a site?**\r\n      * **Yes!** see **FAQ #4**\r\n\r\n   6. **Can Marill crawl sub-domains and sub-folders?**\r\n      * **Yes!** You can pass any url into `--domains` as necessary. For example:\r\n\r\n      ```bash\r\n      $ marill --domains \"https://domain.com/sub/folder/some-page\"\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n      * or with a custom ip as well:\r\n\r\n      ```bash\r\n      $ marill --domains \"https://domain.com/sub/folder/some-page:1.2.3.4\"\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n## Building\r\nMarill supports building on 1.3+ (or even possibly older), however it is recommended to build on the latest go release. Note that you will not be able to use the Makefile to compile Marill if you are trying to build on go 1.4 or lower. You will need to manually compile it, due to limitations with ldflag support.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/Liamraystanley/marill.git\r\n$ cd marill\r\n$ make\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo run unit tests, then compile, simply run:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ make test all\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Project Status\r\n\r\n   * [See here](https://github.com/Liamraystanley/marill/projects/1) for what is being worked on/in my todo list for the first beta release.\r\n   * [See here](https://github.com/Liamraystanley/marill/projects/2) for what is being worked on/in my todo list for the first major release.\r\n   * Head over to [release.liam.sh/marill](https://release.liam.sh/marill/?sort=time&order=desc) to get some testing bundled binaries, if your'e daring and willing to help test my latest pushes.\r\n   * Head over to [Github Releases](https://github.com/Liamraystanley/marill/releases) to get more true-tested builds and versions, with change information.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nBelow are a few guidelines if you would like to contribute to Marill. I'm hoping to keep the code clean, standardized, and much of the quality should match Golang's standard library and common idioms.\r\n\r\n   * Delete local and remote feature branches after merging.\r\n   * Rebase frequently to incorporate upstream changes if you plan to do work in a feature branch.\r\n   * Do not push huge commits. Break them out into smaller, more logical commits.\r\n   * Use a [pull request](https://github.com/Liamraystanley/marill/pulls) if you plan to have something reviewed, before committed.\r\n   * Good commit messages. No generic messages like `fixed`, or `this should be written better`. More `fix X issue (closes #X)` or `implement X (closes #X)`, etc.\r\n   * If you've created more than one commit, [use `git rebase` interactively](https://help.github.com/articles/about-git-rebase/) to squash them into cohesive commits with good messages.\r\n\r\nOther syntactical and Golang-specific things:\r\n\r\n   * Always test using the latest Go version.\r\n   * Always use `gofmt` before committing anything.\r\n   * Always have proper documentation before committing.\r\n   * Keep the same whitespacing, documentation, and newline format as the rest of the project.\r\n   * Always run `make lint` if possible, to ensure you are meeting Golang and community standards.\r\n   * Only use 3rd party libraries if necessary. If only a small portion of the library is needed, simply rewrite it within the library to prevent useless imports.\r\n   * Also see [golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments)\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n    LICENSE: The MIT License (MIT)\r\n    Copyright (c) 2016 Liam Stanley <me@liamstanley.io>\r\n\r\n    Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\n    of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\n    in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\n    to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\n    copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\n    furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n    \r\n    The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\r\n    all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n    \r\n    THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\n    IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\n    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
