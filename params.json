This includes code, exported functions/tools, cli args, etc. This is what I intend to have completed for the beta release:\r\n\r\n- [x] crawling of pages recursively\r\n- [x] scan **Apache**/**Lightspeed** based webservers for domains to fetch\r\n- [x] scan **cPanel** based webservers for domains to fetch\r\n- [ ] scan **Nginx** based webservers for domains to fetch\r\n- [x] cli arg manager [**ACTIVELY BEING MODIFIED**]\r\n- [ ] scan any webserver based on manual cli input [**IN PROGRESS**]\r\n- [ ] return results in a human readible format\r\n- [ ] return results in a bot/script readible format\r\n\r\nThings I would like to have completed for the first major release:\r\n\r\n- [ ] provide potential fixes\r\n- [ ] scan server for possible issues (reference error_log files, webserver error logs, etc)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Building:\r\nMarill supports building on 1.3+ (or even possibly older), however it is recommended to build on the latest go release. Note that you will not be able to use the Makefile to compile Marill if you are trying to build on go 1.4 or lower. You will need to manually compile it, due to limitations with ldflag support.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/Liamraystanley/marill.git\r\n$ cd marill\r\n$ make\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo run unit tests, then compile, simply run:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ make test all\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Usage:\r\nThis is very likely to change quite a bit until we're out of beta. Please use wisely.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ marill --help\r\nNAME:\r\n   marill - Automated website testing utility\r\n\r\nUSAGE:\r\n   marill [global options] command [command options] [arguments...]\r\n   \r\nVERSION:\r\n   git revision XXXXXX\r\n   \r\nAUTHOR(S):\r\n   Liam Stanley <me@liamstanley.io> \r\n   \r\nCOMMANDS:\r\n     help, h  Shows a list of commands or help for one command\r\n\r\nGLOBAL OPTIONS:\r\n   --debug, -d              Print debugging information to stdout\r\n   --quiet, -q              Do not print regular stdout messages\r\n   --no-color               Do not print with color\r\n   --log-file logfile       Log debugging information to logfile\r\n   --cores n                Use n cores to fetch data (0 being server cores/2) (default: 0)\r\n   --domains DOMAIN:IP ...
